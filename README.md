# ActiveDirectoryHomeLab



<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I will create an active directory to manage resources: users, computers, and groups. I will use splunk instance that will injest events from windows server that has the active directory and target windows machine. This project will practice red team skills of brute force attacks to see what telementry it generates. I want to give a big thanks to Steve at MyDFIR for the project idea and how the system works. I will get kali linux skills as well as splunk and how to use it effectively.
